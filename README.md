# 1800 Clothing

Two files: drop from FTP site, and images directly from client Lorie

## Summary 

1800clothing began as a UVU computer science project, and passed from area to area, each adding and altering a little. This resulted in a Frankenstein of a website, with inline HTML styles, bootstrap, PHP, and questionable file organization. The database it operated on to pull 1800 era clothing images and text was nearly undocumented and extremely temperamental. 

Although much of these issues have now been cleaned up, there are still a few points
